## Usage

This application was created for users to provide unique insight on specific television show episodes. User can select the episode they wish to review, read a brief description about the episode and submit a review and score for that episode. The user can even edit and delete their own review if they wish, but other reviews by additional users will not be affected, nor can they be deleted if they were not the user that input that comment or review. Users can submit television show episodes they wish to have reviewed as well. 

This app was created using a ```React``` frontend and a ```Ruby on Rails``` framework backend for the review data. Rails backend template was forked and cloned from Flatiron repository, and ```bundle install``` was used to retrieve Ruby gems. ```React``` frontend was created running ```npm create-react-app```.
